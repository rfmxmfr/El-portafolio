# Important Note About AWS Credentials

There appears to be an issue with the AWS Secret Access Key you provided. 

## Correct Format:
- **Access Key ID**: Typically starts with "AKIA" (like AKIAUGHADWA5YXWXWZO2)
- **Secret Access Key**: Much longer string, doesn't start with "AKIA"

## How to Get Correct Credentials:

1. **Log in to AWS Console**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/
2. Click on your username in the top right
3. Select "Security credentials"
4. Under "Access keys", create a new access key
5. Download the CSV file or copy both the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

## Update Your Credentials:

Run the configuration script again with the correct credentials:
```bash
./configure-aws.sh
```

## Security Note:
- Never share your Secret Access Key
- Consider using IAM roles for production environments
- Rotate your access keys regularly
