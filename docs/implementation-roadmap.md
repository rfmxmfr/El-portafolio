# Implementation Roadmap

## Short Term (1-4 weeks)

### Address Critical Security Issues
- Audit authentication flows and token handling
- Implement proper CORS configuration
- Review and secure API endpoints
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Ensure secure storage of sensitive information

### Implement Proper Error Handling
- Create consistent error handling patterns across components
- Implement global error boundary components
- Add user-friendly error messages
- Log errors for debugging purposes

### Add Loading States for Async Operations
- Implement skeleton loaders for components
- Add loading indicators for API calls
- Ensure UI feedback during long operations
- Prevent multiple form submissions

### Document API Endpoints
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Document request/response formats
- Add examples for each endpoint
- Document authentication requirements

## Medium Term (1-3 months)

### Refactor Large Components
- Break down complex components into smaller, reusable ones
- Implement proper component composition
- Extract business logic into custom hooks
- Standardize component patterns

### Implement Proper Caching Strategy
- Add caching for API responses
- Implement service worker for asset caching
- Use React Query or similar for data fetching and caching
- Optimize image loading and caching

### Add Comprehensive Testing Suite
- Implement unit tests for critical components
