## UI Improvements
- Added robinxtania.png as home button in the admin layout
- Updated admin display name from "Admin" to "rmonteiro"
- Added React Admin dashboard link in the header

## Dashboard Integration
- Created router configuration in main.jsx to support both dashboards:
  - Regular dashboard at /admin
  - React Admin dashboard at /admin-react
- Added a card in the dashboard with a link to the React Admin interface
- Both dashboards are now accessible and working independently

## Deployment
- Updated deployment script with new login credentials
- Fixed build errors by removing AWS Amplify dependencies

## How to Access
